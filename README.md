**Module 1** sweeps through some of the basic concepts on which this course is based. 
**Module 2** is an introduction to Python as a programming language. It skips some [advanced features of Python](https://scipy-lectures.org/advanced/advanced_python/index.html) that may be of interest in an advanced Python programming course.
**Module 3** builds on Module 2 to help develop the skills at which data scientists spend a bulk of their time professionally.
**Module 4** covers analysis and visualization, which is the goal of data science: to draw actionable conclusions.

## History
* Original Jupyter Notebooks for the course in Summer 2019, by Prof. Alva Couch.
* Adapted for Fall 2019 by Jitendra Singh.
