    "\n",
    "Covers the following topics:\n",
    "* **IPython and Jupyter:** provide computational environments for data scientists using Python\n",
    "* **NumPy:** includes the ndarray for efficient storage and manipulation of dense data arrays in Python\n",
    "* **Pandas:** features the DataFrame for efficient storage and manipulation of labeled/columnar data in Python\n",
    "* **Matplotlib:** includes capabilities for a flexible range of data visualizations in Python\n",
    "* **Scikit-Learn:** for efficient and clean Python implementations of the most important and established machine learning algorithms\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The mid-term will be 75 minutes long, *not 120 minutes as previously announced.* This is because finding a location for other than class hours was difficult.\n",
    "1. The exam will be held in two locations: in the classroom or in Boston. I will be sending out a survey to ask which you prefer. There are only about 4 spots available in Boston.\n",
    "1. The exam will be available on our usual place in Jupyterhub but will be encrypted prior to 10:30 on the day o f the exam. The decryption key will be provided at 10:30 via Zoom.\n",
    "1. A mock exam will be available on 10/7 or prior to make sure you have run through the mechanics of taking the text.\n",
    "1. Unless you have informed us of any accommodations, what you have submitted by 11:15 will be considered your submission.\n",
    "1. The assignments 3-01,3-02, 3-03 will not be included.\n",
    "2. You may bring some paper-based notes on the exam.\n",
    "3. During the exam, you may search on the internet just in case if we forget some specific function?\n",
    "4. Not all questions will involve writing code. Some may involve answering text questions in Markdown cells. For code cells, running successfully is important but we may award partial credit, especially if a question is one that most students are struggling with."
